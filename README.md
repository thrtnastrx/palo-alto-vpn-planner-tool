Palo Alto Networks VPN Planning Tool
A web-based tool for planning and generating Panorama CLI commands for site-to-site VPN configurations on Palo Alto Networks firewalls.
Overview
This tool simplifies the process of configuring site-to-site VPNs by providing an intuitive interface for entering configuration parameters and automatically generating the corresponding Panorama CLI commands. It includes features for BGP routing, static routes, proxy IDs, and comprehensive configuration tracking.

Usage Guide
Getting Started

Open the Tool: Load the HTML file in any modern web browser
Fill Required Fields: Start by entering:

Template Name
Device Group
Peer Name (this auto-generates many other fields)



Configuration Workflow
Step 1: Basic Information

Enter Panorama configuration details
Provide peer information and contact details
Document change management information

Step 2: VPN Core Configuration

Configure IKE Gateway settings
Set up IKE and IPSec crypto profiles
Define tunnel interface and IPs
Enter pre-shared key

Step 3: Optional Features

Enable Proxy ID if policy-based VPN is required
Enable BGP for dynamic routing:

Enter ASNs for both sides
Configure prefixes to advertise and receive
BGP addresses auto-populate from tunnel IPs


Enable Static Routes for static routing:

Add multiple routes as needed
Use CIDR dropdown for easy subnet mask selection
Specify next-hop interface if different from tunnel



Step 4: Review and Export

Check the Configuration Summary table
Review generated CLI commands
Copy CLI commands to clipboard
Save configuration for future reference

Field Auto-Population
The tool automatically generates names based on the peer name:

IKE Gateway: {peer-name}-ike-gw
IPSec Tunnel: {peer-name}-ipsec-tunnel
IKE Crypto Profile: {peer-name}-ike
IPSec Crypto Profile: {peer-name}-ipsec
Proxy ID: Proxy-{peer-name}
BGP Peer Group: pg-{peer-name}
BGP Peer Name: {peer-name}-peer

Note: All auto-generated names can be manually edited if needed.
CIDR and Subnet Mask
The tool provides CIDR dropdowns for easy subnet configuration:

Select a CIDR notation (/16 through /31)
Subnet mask auto-populates
Manual entry still available if needed

Supported CIDR notations:

/16 = 255.255.0.0
/17 = 255.255.128.0
/18 = 255.255.192.0
/19 = 255.255.224.0
/20 = 255.255.240.0
/21 = 255.255.248.0
/22 = 255.255.252.0
/23 = 255.255.254.0
/24 = 255.255.255.0
/25 = 255.255.255.128
/26 = 255.255.255.192
/27 = 255.255.255.224
/28 = 255.255.255.240
/29 = 255.255.255.248
/30 = 255.255.255.252 (most common for VPN tunnels)
/31 = 255.255.255.254

Yellow Highlighting
Fields highlighted in yellow are required or recommended to be filled in. After using "Clear All Settings", all configurable fields will be highlighted yellow to indicate they need attention.

Tips and Best Practices
Tunnel IPs

Use /30 subnets (255.255.255.252) for point-to-point tunnels
Common ranges: 169.254.x.x (link-local) or private IP space
Ensure tunnel IPs don't overlap with other networks

BGP Configuration

BGP addresses auto-populate from tunnel IPs for /30 subnets
Use private ASNs (64512-65535) for internal networks
Document advertised prefixes clearly
Hold time should be 3x keep-alive interval (default: 30s/10s)

Static Routes

Specify next-hop interface if routing through specific interface
Leave next-hop interface blank to default to tunnel interface
Document peer's static routes in the notes field for coordination

Crypto Profiles

Use AES-256 for stronger encryption when supported
SHA-256 or higher for hash algorithms
DH Group 14 minimum (2048-bit), Group 19/20 preferred
Match crypto settings with peer device capabilities

Security Policies

Tool auto-generates ICMP policy for tunnel testing
BGP policy automatically created when BGP is enabled
Add additional security policies manually as needed

Change Management

Always document change numbers and dates
Include contact information for coordination
Save configurations before and after changes

Technical Details

Framework: React 18
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Storage: Browser localStorage
File Format: JSON for import/export
No Server Required: Runs entirely in browser

Troubleshooting
CLI Commands Not Generating

Ensure Template, Device Group, and Peer Name are filled in
These three fields are required for CLI generation

Auto-population Not Working

Enter Peer Name first
Auto-population only triggers when Peer Name changes
You can manually edit any auto-generated field

Configurations Not Saving

Check if browser allows localStorage
Ensure you're not in private/incognito mode
Some browsers block localStorage in certain modes

Import Failing

Verify JSON file format is correct
Ensure file was exported from this tool
Check for file corruption

Security Considerations

Pre-shared keys are stored in plain text in saved configurations
Local storage is not encrypted by the browser
Export files contain sensitive information in plain text
Best practice: Don't save configurations on shared computers
Recommendation: Use this tool for planning, then secure PSKs properly
